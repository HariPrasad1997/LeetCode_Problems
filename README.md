# LeetCode_Problems

This repository is dedicated to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.
Iâ€™ve created it to maintain and track all the LeetCode problems I solve during my preparation journey.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose

Maintain a structured collection of solved LeetCode questions.

Build a strong foundation in DSA, problem-solving, and coding patterns.

Keep track of progress and improvements over time.

Act as a quick reference for future revisions.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Included

âœ… Solutions in Java (with clean and optimized code).

âœ… Problem statement links for reference.

âœ… Explanations, approach, and time/space complexity (wherever needed).

âœ… Categorization by topic (Arrays, Strings, Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Goals

Solve X problems per week (you can set your own target).

Cover all important LeetCode Top Interview Questions.

Prepare for coding interviews at product-based companies.
